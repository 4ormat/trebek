Here are the categories, they are: Potent Potables, Countries Between Mexico and Canada, Members of Simon and Garfunkel, I Have a Chardonnay - you choose this category, you automatically get the points and I get to have a glass of wine. Things You Do With a Pencil Sharpener, Tie Your Shoe, and finally, Toast.",
